# Required Toolkit #

Over the course of the semester you will need to install a couple of tools. We're trying to keep it as simple as possible. To do the Break-Out exercises during the tutorials and to complete all assignments, make sure to install these tools beforehand. I've ordered them according to their importance.

- Git. https://git-scm.com/ install it, then go straight ahead to this tutorial, if you don't know git: https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
- NodeJS + npm. https://nodejs.org/en/ ? If you have npm running, install these (you can do that from the Git-Bash):
  - Bower `npm install -g bower`
  - Express Generator `npm install -g express`
  - Polymer-CLI `npm install -g polymer-cli`
  - gulp `npm install -g gulp`
  - Browser-Sync `npm install -g browser-sync`
- Text Editor / Web IDE
  - Atom https://atom.io/
  - Sublime https://www.sublimetext.com/
  - WebStorm (free for students here: https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students)
- XAMP stack. I recommend xampp: https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html . But you can install the components separately, if you like.
- Docker. https://www.docker.com/ If you got this working on your machine, you can use Docker to simply build and run containers. Docker will not be available in the CIP pool though, because it can generate security loop holes in a multi-user environment.
- MongoDB https://www.mongodb.com/ I'm not sure we will need it this year, but you can try it.

I know it seems a lot, but please take the time to install everything, then we can focus on the content during the semester. Please don't hesitate to ask questions or to suggest alternatives!
